Ripped Clothes	Very unprofessional, no matter how trendy
Flip-Flops	Yes they are comfortable and beach-y, but they cannot land you a job
Hats	No matter how bad of a hair day you have, hats are a no-no
Shorts	Slacks are preferred, shorts just scream "Don't hire me". If you are wearing a dress, just be sure it is not revealing.
T-Shirts	Button-ups are preferred, no matter how laid back the company you are interviewing for seems. If you are wearing a dress, just be sure it is not revealing.
Tank Top	Anything you wear to the beach is not interview attire. Button ups are preferred. If you are wearing a dress, just be sure it is not revealing.
